[*View on Codewars*](https://www.codewars.com/kata/a-function-to-display-mottos-for-westerosi-houses)

Given a list of the following major Houses of Westeros and their respective mottos:

```
var houses = [
  {name: "Targaryen", motto: "Fire and Blood"},
  {name: "Stark",     motto: "Winter is Coming"},
  {name: "Bolton",    motto: "Our Blades Are Sharp"},
  {name: "Greyjoy",   motto: "We Do Not Sow"},
  {name: "Tully",     motto: "Family, Duty, Honor"},
  {name: "Arryn",     motto: "As High as Honor"},
  {name: "Lannister", motto: "Hear Me Roar!"},
  {name: "Tyrell",    motto: "Growing Strong"},
  {name: "Baratheon", motto: "Ours is the Fury"},
  {name: "Martell",   motto: "Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken"}
];```

Write a function that, when passed the name of a House, returns its motto. For instance:

```
motto("Tyrell")
```

should return

```
"growing strong"
```
  
If passed an invalid House name, the script should return an empty string.
