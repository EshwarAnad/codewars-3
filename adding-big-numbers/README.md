# Adding Big Numbers
[*View on Codewars*](https://www.codewars.com/kata/adding-big-numbers)

We need to sum big numbers and we require your help.

Write a function that returns the sum of two numbers. The input numbers are strings and the function must return a string.

## Example

```javascript
add("123", "321"); -> "444"
add("11", "99"); -> "110"
```
```coffeescript
add("123", "321") -> "444"
add("11", "99") -> "110"
```

## Notes 

* The input numbers are _big_.
* The input is a string of only digits
* The numbers are positives
