# Are the brackets balanced?
[*View on Codewars*](https://www.codewars.com/kata/are-the-brackets-balanced)

Given a string which may include opening or closing round brackets, can you tell whether the string contains a balanced pair(s) of round brackets, that is there are no brackets which are either opened & not closed, or vice versa.  Opening round brackets always have to come before closing bracket. An empty string is balanced.
