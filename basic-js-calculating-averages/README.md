# Basic JS - Calculating averages
[*View on Codewars*](https://www.codewars.com/kata/basic-js-calculating-averages)

Let's build a calculator that can calculate the average for an arbitrary number of arguments.

The test expects you to provide a Calculator object with an average method:
```
Calculator.average()
```

The test also expects that when you pass no arguments, it returns 0. The arguments are expected to be integers.

It expects Calculator.average(3,4,5) to return 4.
