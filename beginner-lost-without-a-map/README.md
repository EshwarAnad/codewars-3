[*View on Codewars*](https://www.codewars.com/kata/beginner-lost-without-a-map)

Given an array of integers, return a new array with each value doubled.

For example:

`[1, 2, 3] --> [2, 4, 6]`

For the beginner, try to use the `map` method - it comes in very handy quite a lot so is a good one to know.
