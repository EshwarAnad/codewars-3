[*View on Codewars*](https://www.codewars.com/kata/beginner-series-number-2-clock)

Clock shows 'h' hours, 'm' minutes and 's' seconds after midnight.

Your task is to make 'Past' function which returns time converted to miliseconds.

#####Example:

```javascript
past(0, 1, 1) == 61000
```
```csharp
Past(0, 1, 1) == 61000
```
```python
past(0, 1, 1) == 61000
```
```ruby
past(0, 1, 1) == 61000
```
```java
Past(0, 1, 1) == 61000
```

Note! h, m and s will be only Natural numbers!
