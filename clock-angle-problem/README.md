# Clock - angle problem
[*View on Codewars*](https://www.codewars.com/kata/clock-angle-problem)

Couple of days ago, my close friend had an interview for the position of Software Engineer Intern in a small company in Germany. Today I asked him what were the questions. He told me that one of the tasks (which was considered as one of the quite challenging for beginners) was "Clock Angle Problem". Idea is the following:

According to Wikipedia: Clock angle problem is a type of mathematical problem which involves finding the angles between the hands of an analog clock. Clock angle problems relate two different measurements: angles and time. The angle is typically measured in degrees from the mark of number 12 clockwise. The time is usually based on 12-hour clock.

Your task is the following: Given a 12-hour analog clock, compute in degree the smaller angle between the hour and minute hands. 

###Examples

```csharp
ClockProblem.calculateAngle(5,24) // => 18, as time is 5:24, angle is 18 degress
ClockProblem.calculateAngle(7,30) // => 45, as time is 7:30, angle is 45 degress
```

```java
ClockProblem.calculateAngle(5,24) // => 18, as time is 5:24, angle is 18 degress
ClockProblem.calculateAngle(7,30) // => 45, as time is 7:30, angle is 45 degress
```

```python
calculate_angle(5,24) # => 18, as time is 5:24, angle is 18 degress
calculate_angle(7,30) # => 45, as time is 7:30, angle is 45 degress
```

```ruby
calculate_angle(5,24) # => 18, as time is 5:24, angle is 18 degress
calculate_angle(7,30) # => 45, as time is 7:30, angle is 45 degress
```

```javascript
calculateAngle(5,24) // Time is 5:24, angle is 18 degress
calculateAngle(7,30) // Time is 7:30, angle is 45 degress
```
