# Collatz Conjecture Length
[*View on Codewars*](https://www.codewars.com/kata/collatz-conjecture-length)

The Collatz Conjecture states that for any natural number n, if n is even, divide it by 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. If you repeat the process continously for n, n will eventually reach 1.

For example, if n = 20, the resulting sequence will be:

[20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1] 

Write a program that will output the length of the Collatz Conjecture for any given n. In the example above, the output would be 8.
