# Disemvowel Trolls
[*View on Codewars*](https://www.codewars.com/kata/disemvowel-trolls)

Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

Note: for this kata `y` isn't considered a vowel.
