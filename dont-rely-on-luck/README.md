# Don't rely on luck.
[*View on Codewars*](https://www.codewars.com/kata/dont-rely-on-luck)

The test fixture I use for this kata is pre-populated.

It will compare your guess to a random number generated using:

```ruby 
(Kernel::rand() * 100 + 1).floor
```
```javascript
Math.floor(Math.random() * 100 + 1)
```
```python
randint(1,100)
```
```php
rand(1, 100)
```

You can pass by relying on luck or skill but try not to rely on luck.

Good luck!
