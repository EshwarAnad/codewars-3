[*View on Codewars*](https://www.codewars.com/kata/find-numbers-which-are-divisible-by-given-number)

Complete the function which takes two arguments and returns all numbers which are divisible by the given divisor. First argument is an array of `numbers` and the second is the `divisor`.

## Example

```javascript
divisibleBy([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2) == [2, 4, 6]
```
```coffeescript
divisibleBy([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2) == [2, 4, 6]
```
```python
divisible_by([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2) == [2, 4, 6]
```
```php
divisible_by([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2) == [2, 4, 6]
```
```ruby
divisible_by([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2) == [2, 4, 6]
```
```elixir
divisible_by([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2) == [2, 4, 6]
```
```cpp
divisible_by({1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, 2) == {2, 4, 6}
```
```csharp
DivisibleBy(new int[]{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, 2) == new int[] {2, 4, 6}
```
```haskell
divisibleBy :: [Int] -> Int -> [Int]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] `divisibleBy` 2 = [2, 4, 6]
```
