[*View on Codewars*](https://www.codewars.com/kata/find-the-remainder)

Write a function that accepts two arguments and returns the remainder after dividing the larger number by the smaller number. Division by zero should return NaN (in C#, throw a new `DivideByZeroException` instead). Arguments will both be integers.
