# First non-repeating character
[*View on Codewars*](https://www.codewars.com/kata/first-non-repeating-character)

Write a function named `first_non_repeating_letter` that takes a string input, and returns the first character that is not repeated anywhere in the string.

For example, if given the input `'stress'`, the function should return `'t'`, since the letter *t* only occurs once in the string, and occurs first in the string.

As an added challenge, upper- and lowercase letters are considered the **same character**, but the function should return the correct case for the initial letter.  For example, the input `'sTreSS'` should return `'T'`.

If a string contains *all repeating characters*, it should return an empty string (`""`) or `None` -- see sample tests.
