# Friend or Foe?
[*View on Codewars*](https://www.codewars.com/kata/friend-or-foe)

Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.

If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...

Ex: Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"], Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]

Note: keep the original order of the names in the output.
