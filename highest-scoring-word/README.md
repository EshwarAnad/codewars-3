Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word.

Each letter of a word scores points according to its position in the alphabet: `a = 1, b = 2, c = 3` etc.

You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.

If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string.

All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.
