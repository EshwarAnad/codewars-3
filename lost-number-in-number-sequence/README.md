# Lost number in number sequence
[*View on Codewars*](https://www.codewars.com/kata/lost-number-in-number-sequence)

An ordered sequence of numbers from 1 to N is given. One number might have deleted from it, then the remaining numbers were mixed. Find the number that was deleted.

Example: 
 - The starting array sequence is `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`
 - The mixed array with one deleted number is `[3,2,4,6,7,8,1,9]`
 - Your function should return the int `5`.

If no number was deleted from the array and no difference with it, your function should return the int `0`.

Note that N may be 1 or less (in the latter case, the first array will be `[]`).
