# Math Issues
[*View on Codewars*](https://www.codewars.com/kata/math-issues)

Oh no, our Math object was "accidently" reset. Can you re-implement some of those functions? We can assure, that only non-negative numbers are passed as arguments. So you don't have to consider things like `undefined`, `null`, `NaN`, negative numbers, strings and so on.

Here is a list of functions, we need:

* Math.round()
* Math.ceil()
* Math.floor()
