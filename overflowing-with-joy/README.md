# Overflowing with joy
[*View on Codewars*](https://www.codewars.com/kata/overflowing-with-joy)

Multiply two ints, but take care of overflow. If the result cannot be accurately stored in an int, throw an ArithmeticException.

(If this is too easy, try [overflowing with longing](/kata/overflowing-with-longing).)
