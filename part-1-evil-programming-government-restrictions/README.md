The evil programming government has banned the use of numbers.
Your task, if you choose to accept it is to return numbers, without using numbers.

Problems:   

- You can't use number literals in your source code. 
- You can't use the length property directly in your code.   



   
Goal:

- You have to return 'I can write numbers like, 1, 2, 3.'
