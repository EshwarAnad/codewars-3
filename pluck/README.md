# Pluck
[*View on Codewars*](https://www.codewars.com/kata/pluck)

Implement `pluck`, which takes an array of objects and a property name, and returns an array containing the named property of each object.

For example:

    pluck([{a:1}, {a:2}], 'a') // -> [1,2]

If an object is missing the property, you should just leave it as `undefined` in the output array.
