# Prime Streaming (PG-13)
[*View on Codewars*](https://www.codewars.com/kata/prime-streaming-pg-13)

Create an endless stream of prime numbers - a bit like ```IntStream.of(2,3,5,7,11,13,17)```, but infinite. The stream must be able to produce a million primes in a few seconds.

If this is too easy, try [Prime Streaming (NC-17)](/kata/prime-streaming-nc-17/).
