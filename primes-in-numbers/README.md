[*View on Codewars*](https://www.codewars.com/kata/primes-in-numbers)

Given a positive number n > 1 find the prime factor decomposition of n.
The result will be a string with the following form :
```
 "(p1**n1)(p2**n2)...(pk**nk)"
```
with the p(i) in increasing order and n(i) empty if
n(i) is 1.
```
Example: n = 86240 should return "(2**5)(5)(7**2)(11)"
```
