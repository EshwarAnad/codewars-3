# Replace With Alphabet Position
[*View on Codewars*](https://www.codewars.com/kata/replace-with-alphabet-position)

Welcome.

In this kata you are required to, given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet.

If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it.

a being 1, b being 2, etc.

As an example:

```python
alphabet_position("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.")
```
```csharp
Kata.AlphabetPosition("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.")
```
```php
alphabet_position('The sunset sets at twelve o\' clock.');
```

Should return `"20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11"` as a string.
