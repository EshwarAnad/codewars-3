# Sort by Example
[*View on Codewars*](https://www.codewars.com/kata/sort-by-example)

Given an Array and an Example-Array to sort to, write a function that sorts the Array following the Example-Array.

Assume Example Array catalogs all elements possibly seen in the input Array. However, the input Array does not necessarily have to have all elements seen in the Example.

Example:

Arr:
[1,3,4,4,4,4,5]

Example Arr:
[4,1,2,3,5]

Result:
[4,4,4,4,1,3,5]
