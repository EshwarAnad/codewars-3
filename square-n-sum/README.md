# Square(n) Sum
[*View on Codewars*](https://www.codewars.com/kata/square-n-sum)

Complete the square sum function so that it squares each number passed into it and then sums the results together.

For example, for `[1, 2, 2]` it should return `9` because `1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 9`.

```if:racket
In Racket, use a list instead of an array, so '(1 2 3) should return 9.
```
