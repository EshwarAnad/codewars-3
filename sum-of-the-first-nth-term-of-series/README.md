[*View on Codewars*](https://www.codewars.com/kata/sum-of-the-first-nth-term-of-series)

## Task:

Your task is to write a function which returns the sum of following series upto nth term(parameter).

    Series: 1 + 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/10 + 1/13 + 1/16 +...
 
## Rules:
 
* You need to round the answer to 2 decimal places and return it as String.

* If the given value is 0 then it should return 0.00

* You will only be given Natural Numbers as arguments.

## Examples:

    SeriesSum(1) => 1 = "1.00"
    SeriesSum(2) => 1 + 1/4 = "1.25"
    SeriesSum(5) => 1 + 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/10 + 1/13 = "1.57"
    
**NOTE**: In PHP the function is called `series_sum()`.
