[*View on Codewars*](https://www.codewars.com/kata/thinkful-string-drills-repeater)

Write a function named `repeater()` that takes two arguments (a string and a number), and returns a new string where the input string is repeated that many times.

## Example:


```cpp
Repeater.repeat("a", 5)
```
```c
repeater("a", 5)
```

should return
```cpp
"aaaaa"
```
```c
"aaaaa"
```
